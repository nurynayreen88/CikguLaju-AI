# RPH Variation Engine v2.1 — Seed Activity Bank

This seed bank operationalises RPH_VARIATION_ENGINE_V2.md using original CikguLaju activity patterns derived from:
- user-supplied Year 1 / phonics lesson-plan examples,
- user-supplied transition-module examples,
- general teacher-resource benchmarking,
while keeping DSKP/RPT/SOW as curriculum source of truth.

## Runtime contract
Each candidate activity is selected only after verified Lesson + exact SK/SP + skill/focus are locked.
Third-party wording must never be copied into runtime output.

## Two-session progression
For a verified repeated RPT block with same lesson number/SK/SP:
Session 1 uses input/recognition/controlled practice families.
Session 2 must use retrieval/application/production/assessment families.
Do not generate two near-identical routes.

## PRIMARY YEAR 1 ENGLISH — VERIFIED CONTENT-FIRST SEED RULES

These rules are grounded in the user-supplied Primary Year 1 Scheme of Work and lesson-plan references.

### SOW structure lock
Primary Year 1 lessons include both textbook-based and non-textbook-based lessons.
- From Lesson 6 onward, textbook-based lessons use Superminds 1 as the lesson spine.
- Non-textbook-based lessons recycle/consolidate previously learned language and skills.
- Main and complementary standards may target different skills in the same lesson.
- RPH objectives may be derived from both, but the main skill remains primary.

### Differentiation patterns extracted from the verified SOW
Use as selectable differentiation logic:
- vary task difficulty;
- vary amount/type of support: teacher talk, gestures, visuals, written support;
- vary expected outcome;
- vary time allowance;
- vary grouping/roles;
- use closed vs open questions appropriately;
- vary feedback according to pupil readiness.
For low-literacy pupils, use supplementary foundational literacy support where the SOW indicates this is appropriate.

### Content-specific route example: Friends — colours / classroom instructions
When a verified Lesson Content Pack contains the colour language and classroom-instruction focus:
- PRE: activate colour words through a quick recognition/retrieval task.
- INPUT: teacher models short supported classroom instructions linked to colours.
- GUIDED RESPONSE: pupils point to real classroom objects matching the instructed colour.
- CONTROLLED PRACTICE: pupils repeat in small groups.
- APPLICATION: game-like instruction-following task using the same colour vocabulary.
- WRITING LINK: pupils write/copy the verified target colour words when the complementary writing standard applies.
- POST: extend to two-item instructions or memory/retrieval using the same verified language.
Do not reuse these colour-specific steps for unrelated lessons.

### Content-specific route example: Friends — colour-word reading / phonics
When the Lesson Content Pack is verified as colour-word recognition / sound-letter work:
- PRE: retrieve colour vocabulary already taught.
- INPUT: identify letter shapes and target initial sounds from verified colour words.
- GUIDED PRACTICE: model segmentation/blending or letter-to-sound connection as required by the verified standard.
- PAIR/GROUP PRACTICE: pupils assemble or match sound/letter units to form the verified colour words.
- WRITING: pupils record the target words with visual colour support.
- PBD: observe recognition, sound production, blending/word formation, or legible written response according to the locked SK/SP.
This pattern must only be selected when the verified lesson content supports it.

### Content-specific route example: At School — project/application
When the Lesson Content Pack contains classroom/school vocabulary and a project-style task:
- use the textbook/source task as the application spine;
- scaffold pupils to identify/categorise the verified vocabulary first;
- move into pair/group product creation;
- require oral description/presentation using the same verified language;
- assess the product and/or oral response against the linked skill.
Generated CikguLaju follow-up should use a different response format from the source task.

### Pre/Post activity library grounded in Year 1 SOW
Eligible families include:
- remember-and-share;
- missing-item recall;
- phonics odd-one-out / same-sound discrimination;
- pass-the-card vocabulary review;
- spot-the-difference from a known text;
- picture/text connection;
- guess-the-word;
- error correction from pupil work;
- remember-and-say;
- whisper-and-write;
- listen-and-point;
- word ladder;
- memory test using a verified picture;
- personal connection to target vocabulary;
- short pupil reflection on what they remember.

These are route patterns only. Runtime wording and lesson content must be original and tied to the Lesson Content Pack.

### Selection guard
The engine must not choose an attractive activity merely because it is age-appropriate.
It must first pass:
1. exact Lesson Content Pack relevance,
2. main/complementary skill compatibility,
3. exact SK/SP compatibility,
4. textbook/non-textbook lesson type compatibility,
5. class/time/readiness fit.
